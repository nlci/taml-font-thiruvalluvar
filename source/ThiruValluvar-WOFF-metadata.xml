      SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
      -----------------------------------------------------------
      
      PREAMBLE
      The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
      development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
      efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
      open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
      with others.
      
      The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
      redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
      fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
      redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
      names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
      however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
      requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
      to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
      
      DEFINITIONS
